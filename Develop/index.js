# ${answers.projectTitle}
## Description
${answers.description}
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
## Installation
${answers.installationInst}
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
${answers.usageInst}
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an "assets/images" folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
  
## Credits
${answers.ghUsername}- Github

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-${answers.license}-blue) //
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
---
üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
## Badges
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
${answers.contributionInst}
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
${answers.testingInst}
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
